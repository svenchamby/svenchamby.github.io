				<h2>Races</h2>
				<p>There are many races in the worlds of D&D, from mystical elves, to sturdy dwarves, to the ever present and resourceful humans. What race you choose to play will have a significant impact on your game as it will greatly affect what inherent abilities you have as well as the way people in the game view your character. For example, in the Forgotten Realms setting, dark elves are known for their inborn prowess with magic and stealth but are feared because of their cruel and evil tendencies. Below you will find a guide that will help you choose a race that best suits your play style and interests.</p>
