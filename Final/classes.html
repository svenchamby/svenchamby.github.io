				<h2>Classes</h2>
				<p>In D&D, a class is like a character's profession. One might choose to devote their life to serving their patron god and become a cleric. Another might study magic as a wizard or be a mighty warrior from a barbarian tribe. Your character's class will be most important in determining what your character can do. Combat styles, the ability to cast spells, and your character's various skills will largely be derived from what attributes are afforded them by their class. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses and the guide below will help you in determining which class you'd like to play.</p>
