				<h2>Backgrounds</h2>
				<p>Adventurers come from all kinds of places and have lived as varied lives as one can imagine. A character's background specifies where he or she is from and how that person grew up. From that background, a character derives unique skills, habits, and bonds. A background can help shape your character and greatly influence how you play based on how your character would react to certain situations. For example, a character who grew up on the streets, oppressed by a noble lord, might look upon disdain upon kings and nobility. Another character, from a more scholarly background, might inquisitively seek out hidden mysteries. The guide below will help you choose a background that will add depth to your character.</p>
