					<h2>Char EnGen Site Plan</h2>
					<h3>by Steven Chamberlain</h3>
					<p>Note: The following project plan has been ammended from its original to better suit the purposes of this site and the project guidelines.</p>
					<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
					<p>My project is a website for creating characters for the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. It will feature information on classes, races, and other features as well as a JavaScript based character generator.
					</p>
					<h4>The Audience</h4>
					<p>The audience will be D&D players, particularly those who are new to the game or simply want to make a character quickly.
					</p>

					<h4>Pages</h4>
					<p>Most every page, except the generator, will be headed by an image. A json file will be created containing information about each race, class, and background that will be displayed on the appropriate pages via a series of buttons.
					</p>
					<p>Home – The home page will include a brief description about the site’s purpose and step-by-step instructions as to how to create a character via a video.</p>
					<p>Races – Will outline general details about each playable race in the generator. A button for each race will retrieve and display information from a json file.</p>
					<p>Classes – Will outline details about each playable class in the generator. Again, class information will be retrieved and displayed from a json file via buttons.</p>
					<p>Backgrounds – Will be a basic guide to backgrounds and will assist in choosing one. This page will also retrieve info from a json file as the two preceding pages.</p>
					<p>Generator – Will include the generator itself, a JavaScript file, implemented into the page.</p>
					<h4>Wireframe Sketches</h4>
					<p>Note: The medium sized wireframe was not implemented due the fact that the large layout worked for both mediums and looked best on tablets.</p>
