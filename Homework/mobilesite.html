		<h2>Mobile Site Analysis</h2>
		<p>For 24 hours, we browsed the internet using nothing but our mobile devices. We looked at how these mobile pages utilized the basic principles of design and looked for the best designed sites.</p> Proximity - Daniel Southwick
		<br> <img src="wikiproximity.PNG" alt="wikipedia.org" height="300"> <img src="IMG_0049.PNG" alt="wikipedia.org mobile" height="300">
		<p>wikipedia.org - The language options are all the same proximity from the Wikipedia logo. The Wikipedia title and the search bar are also the same proximity above and below the logo. There is empty space on both sides of the central design. This page very simple to use. The focus of the user is quickly drawn to the center of the page where it should be.</p> Alignment - Steven Chamberlain
		<br> <img src="IMG_0045%202.PNG" alt="my.byui.edu" height="300">
		<p>my.BYUI.edu - The my.byui homepage is a good example of alignment in web design. This page features multiple elements like navigation menus, ads, notifications, and more, but all are aligned and all belong together. It is very easy to let a page such as this become discordant and unorginized, but here we see a well functioning and navigable web page.</p> Repetition - Daniel Southwick
		<br> <img src="themerepetition.png" alt="Theme Magazine" height="300">
		<p>theme.com - This particular blog uses a uniform color for nearly all article headings. They are all orange. The rest is black or grey. This creates a contrast that exposes the repetition and unifies the whole page.</p> Contrast - Austin Bowler
		<br> <img src="IMG_3011.PNG" alt="Rexburg Hero Party" height="300">
		<p>rexburgheroparty.weebly.com - The design element of contrast is included in this mobile web page in many ways, the first and most obvious being in color. The colors red and black have a high contrast, so that the eye can differentiate between text/ clickable items (in black and white) and the background. There is also a high contrasting blue in the lower right hand corner, which attracts the eye to it (it figures, because that is a discount button). Another element of contrast is in size. Because of the size of text in the title and the size of the button, human eyes are attracted to those first, which are what the owner wants you to see first; I know because the owner is me. The last element of contrast in this mobile web page is in type. There is a font change after the title, changing from decorative to the body text, which is sans-serif. This was done in order to attract the eye to the title and make it look unique. This is also replicated in other pages in the web site.</p> Typography - Steven Chamberlain
		<br> <img src="IMG_0041.PNG" alt="Inverse.com" height="300"> <img src="IMG_0042.PNG" alt="Inverse.com" height="300"> <img src="IMG_0043.PNG" alt="Inverse.com" height="300">
		<p>inverse.com - In interview articles such as this, good typography is necessary to keep the viewer's interest and to help differentiate the interviewer from the interviewed. This article does a great job of that. Using contrast in color, size, font families, and styles this page creates interest and pacing throughout the article. It's easier to find information and interesting topics. The whole page is very readable, especially for such a small format. Plus, the font choices are just that. Choice.</p>
