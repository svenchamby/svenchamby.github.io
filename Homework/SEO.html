	<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
	<h3>Definition</h3>
	<p class="define">The process of affecting the visibility of a website or web page in a web search engine’s unpaid results.</p> <img src="Periodic-Table.png" alt="The periodic table of Search Engine Optimizatin Success">
	<p>Improving your rankings in search engine results can greatly increase awareness for your site and help potential clients find you. However, you have to know what search engines are looking for.</p>
	<h3>What Are Search Engines Looking For?</h3>
	<h4>Content</h4>
	<p>Particularly words. When a user creates a search, the engine looks at each word in each webpage in order to match it with the user’s keywords. This includes appropriately marked alt tags for images and well designed UX.</p>
	<h4>Titles</h4>
	<p>An effective title will help get more effective search results, as a search engine puts a lot of weight into titles. Titles usually summarize the content of the page.</p>
	<h4>Links</h4>
	<p>Links to your page are like recommendations to a search engine. The more links you have from trustworthy sites, the more weight your page will have in a search.</p>
	<p>Search engines take words used in links into account. For example, if a link leading to Audible.com contains the word “audio book,” then the search engine will associate Audible with audio books.</p>
	<h4>Reputation</h4>
	<p> Sites with quality content and links will often do better in search rankings. Improving the quality of your content and providing better UX will help boost your website in search results. </p>

	<h3>What to Avoid</h3>
	<p>Here's a list of 'Do-Nots' that search engines are programmed to avoid:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Too many Keywords</li>
		<li>Too many Ads</li>
		<li>Link Buying</li>
		<li>Identical Content</li>
		<li>Hidden Text or Links</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As a rule of thumb, focus on quality content and don't try to cheat the system. People who work at Google are smarter than you.</p>
