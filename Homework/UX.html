	<h2>User Experience</h2>
	<p>Perhaps the most important part of design of any kind is user experience. Whether one is a graphic designer, web developer, inventor, marketer, writer, craftsmen, or anyone else who is trying to sell something, they rely on the user having an enjoyable experience. </p>
	<h3>What is User Experience?</h3>
	<p>User Experience is everything that has to do with your product and the consumer's experience with it. It is "the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product. User experience design encompasses traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as percieved by users" (Wikipedia) UX covers everything from shipping and installation to customer service to user reviews both online and word of mouth and beyond. If it concerns both your customer and your product, it's part of UX.</p>
	<h3>Elements of UX</h3>
	<p>There are three important elements that make up effective UX design (there are more, but for now we'll focus on these). They are Visual or Uer interface Design, Information Architecture, and Interaction Design.</p>
	<h4>Visual/User Interface Design</h4>
	<p>User interface (UI) design can be quite broad since it combines concepts from nearly all other elements of UX. UI is all about what the user sees and how they "physically" interact with the product. Good design anticipates the needs of the user and provides for those needs with little to no hastle. Thus, the best designs are simple, consistent, and predictable. Nothing is more frustrating than not knowing how to use a product, especially if you paid for it.</p>
	<p>Here are some simple rules to follow when working on UI design:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep it Simple! - If it isn't necessary, take it out. Make sure your design is clear and deliberate.</li>
		<li>Create Consistency - Use commonly used elements, like checkboxes, buttons, drop-down menus, etc., and repeat those elements througout your design. One can be avant-garde, but only if one accompanies innovation with usability.</li>
		<li>Strategically Use Color and Texture - These are great ways to grab and direct a user's attention, but don't go overboard and be aware of basic color theory.</li>
		<li>Use Good Typography - Create hierarchy and increase readability. Good typography is seldom recognized but is highly effective while bad typography is noticable and drives people away.</li>
		<li>Make the System Communicate - Let the user know what's happening. If a change in the system or an error occurs, or if the system is updating or loading, let the user know.</li>
		<li>Think About Defaults - Keep in mind the needs of the typical user and design some default settings that cater to those needs.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Information Architecture</h4>
	<p>Information architecture is just what the name suggests, the structuring of information. This occurs at the base level, relating one bit of information to another and organizing them into distinct and meaningful groups. Information architecture's main concern is maximizing usability and findability. Usability is how a product, digital or non-, can be used to achieve a specific goal effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorally. Findability is how easy it is to find required information without having to search, browse, or ask for it. </p>
	<h4>Interaction Design</h4>
	<p>Interaction design is all about how the user will use the product. Rather than creating concrete designs, ID is more of a study of behavior and focuses on how things could be better. Good ID takes the following things into consideration:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Identifying and defining interaction patterns best suited in the context</li>
		<li>Incorporating user needs</li>
		<li>Interface behavior, such as shortcuts and mouse-over actions</li>
		<li>Effectively communicating system strengths</li>
		<li>Making the interface intuitive</li>
		<li>Maintaining consistency</li>
	</ul>
