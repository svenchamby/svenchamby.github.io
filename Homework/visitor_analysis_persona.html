				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>This is a site that caters to a broad spectrum of people with multiple interests, yet it does so quite well. The typical user would be one who is immersed in internet culture, more than likely teens to adults in their mid-thirties, who are looking for entertainment, though those outside this demographic would not have a hard time finding what they needed on this page. The layout is simple and focused. The mobile version cuts out a lot of the fluff in the sidebars in favor of a content-oriented, single column format. For a site that mostly hosts images and videos, that is ideal. The navigation bar is kept off the screen and is accessed through the click of a button, a commonly used mobile element that I greatly appreciate. With so little room on a mobile screen, one needs to find a way to maximize content. It's for the above reasons that I prefer Cheezburger's mobile site to their desktop site and even their app. </p>

				<h2>Site Contrast</h2>
				<h3>iLearn</h3>
				<p> URL: byui.brightspace.com </p>
				<p> This is a site where students at BYU-I can access online content for their classes. A majority of the work submitted at BYU-I is done through iLearn. Unlike the site above, which merely adjusts itself for a mobile sized screen, iLearn has a completely separate site for mobile users. While iLearn seems to know its target demographic, it severely hampers the utilization of mobile users. Much of the content is simply inaccessible, with very little "content" showing. Everything that is accessible, which is mostly due dates and updates from instructors, are all featured on the home page. One can dig through the site to find class specific content, but it hardly changes anything, as upcoming events are always the main feature and little else shows. After spending several minutes of digging, I wasn't even able to access discussion threads, a feature that would be very convenient to have on my mobile.
					<br> This site isn't the worst site I've ever visited on mobile, but it is certainly one of the most pointless. I typically navigate to the desktop site, as the constant zooming in and out is much more preferable to severely lacking in content and accessibility. </p>
