		<h3>What Are Search Engines Looking For?</h3>
		<h4>Content</h4>
		<p>Particularly words. When a user creates a search, the engine looks at each word in each webpage in order to match it with the user’s keywords. This includes appropriately marked alt tags for images and well designed UX.</p> <img src="content.png" alt="Search engines look for keywords within your website's content">
		<h4>Titles</h4>
		<p>An effective title will help get more effective search results, as a search engine puts a lot of weight into titles. Titles usually summarize the content of the page.</p> <img src="titles.png" alt="Search engines look at the title of your webpage to summarize content">
		<h4>Links</h4>
		<p>Links to your page are like recommendations to a search engine. The more links you have from trustworthy sites, the more weight your page will have in a search.</p>
		<p>Search engines take words used in links into account. For example, if a link leading to Audible.com contains the word “audio book,” then the search engine will associate Audible with audio books.</p> <img src="links1.png" alt="Links from reputable sites will boost your site's rankings">
		<h4>Reputation</h4>
		<p> Sites with quality content and links will often do better in search rankings. Improving the quality of your content and providing better UX will help boost your website in search results. </p>
